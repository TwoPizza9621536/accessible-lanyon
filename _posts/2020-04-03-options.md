## Dark mode

**Dark mode is enabled automatically** via CSS media queryâ€”you'll find the
source code for this in the `_sass/_variables.scss` stylesheet through media
queries. [Read more about using CSS dark mode][1] via media queries like this:

{% highlight scss %}
// Example media query to detect dark mode
@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
  // ...
}
{% endhighlight %}
